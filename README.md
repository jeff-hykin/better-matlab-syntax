# What does this do?
This will get you just the syntax highlighting for MATLAB. No language server or anything else that would slow down the startup time of VS Code.

## How do I use it?
Just install the VS Code extension and the changes will automatically be applied to all relevent files.

## Contributing
If you'd like to help improve the syntax, take a look at `main/main.rb`. And make sure to take a look at `CONTRIBUTING.md` to get a better idea of how code works.
